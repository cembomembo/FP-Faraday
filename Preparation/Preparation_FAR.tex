\section{Introduction}

The Faraday effect is a magneto-optical phenomenon in which the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light rotates while passing through a transparent medium in an axial magnetic field.
For small rotations, the angle $\theta$ scales with the magnetic flux density $B$ and the path length $L$ in the material, $\theta = VBL$, where $V$ is the material- and wavelength-dependent Verdet constant.
Discovered by Michael Faraday in 1845, the effect is widely regarded as one of the first experimental hints that light and electromagnetism are deeply connected.

What makes Faraday rotation especially useful is that it is non-reciprocal, meaning the sense of rotation does not simply cancel when light travels back through the same element.  
This is why Faraday rotators are used in optical isolators, which act like optical diodes and protect lasers from harmful back reflections~\cite{FARAnleitung}.
Faraday rotation is also used as a sensing principle, for example in fiber-optic current sensors in which the polarization rotation induced by the magnetic field of a current-carrying conductor is used to infer the current magnitude~\cite{mihailovic_fos_faraday_2021}.

In this experiment, we measure the Verdet constant of optical glasses at several wavelengths and relate the observed rotation strength to the wavelength dependence of the refractive index using simple dispersion-based models.

\section{Physical Principles}

In the following, we develop the Faraday rotation effect from basic polarization optics and wave propagation in matter to the practical signal extraction method used in the experiment.

\subsection{Polarization States of Light}

We consider a monochromatic plane wave propagating in the $+z$ direction, so that the electric field $\mathbf{E}(z,t)$ oscillates transversely in the $x$-$y$ plane.
Linear polarization means that the tip of the electric field vector oscillates back and forth along a fixed line in the transverse plane, for example along the $x$ axis, $E_x(z,t)=E_0\cos(\omega t-kz)$ and $E_y(z,t)=0$.

Circular polarization means that the tip of the electric field vector rotates at constant magnitude in the transverse plane, which occurs when two orthogonal components of equal amplitude have a phase shift of $\pm 90^\circ$.
A convenient representation is
\begin{align}
\text{RCP:}\quad &E_x^{(r)}(z,t)=E_0\cos(\omega t-kz),\quad E_y^{(r)}(z,t)=E_0\sin(\omega t-kz), \\
\text{LCP:}\quad &E_x^{(l)}(z,t)=E_0\cos(\omega t-kz),\quad E_y^{(l)}(z,t)=-E_0\sin(\omega t-kz),
\end{align}
where the opposite sign in $E_y$ corresponds to the opposite sense of rotation.

A central fact for the Faraday effect is that a linearly polarized wave can be written as the superposition of a left- and a right-circularly polarized wave of equal amplitude.  
Intuitively, adding two counter-rotating circular motions of the same strength cancels the rotational character and leaves a back-and-forth oscillation along a fixed direction, i.e. linear polarization.
This decomposition is particularly useful because Faraday rotation arises when the medium causes the left- and right-circular components to accumulate different phases during propagation, which then leads to a rotation of their linear superposition.

\subsection{Phase Accumulation in a Medium and the Refractive Index}

To understand how the refractive index enters the Faraday effect, it is useful to describe light propagation in terms of wave phase.
We consider a monochromatic plane wave propagating in the $+z$ direction and focus on a single transverse field component, for example $E_x(z,t)$.

In vacuum, a monochromatic plane wave can be written as
\begin{equation}
E_x(z,t) = E_0 \cos(\omega t - k_0 z),
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency and $k_0 = 2\pi / \lambda_0$ is the vacuum wavenumber.
The spatial term $k_0 z$ determines how quickly the phase of the wave changes as it propagates along the $z$ direction.

When light enters a medium with refractive index $n$, its frequency remains unchanged, but its wavelength is reduced to $\lambda = \lambda_0 / n$.
As a result, the phase changes more rapidly with position and the wavenumber increases to
\begin{equation}
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_0 / n} = n k_0.
\end{equation}
A larger refractive index therefore means that the phase of the wave ``winds up'' faster per unit length inside the material.

After propagating a distance $L$ through the medium, the accumulated spatial phase advance is
\begin{equation}
\phi = kL = n k_0 L = n \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_0} L.
\end{equation}
This phase directly measures how many oscillation cycles the wave completes over the distance $L$.

This situation is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase_accumulation}, which shows how the wavelength is shortened inside a dielectric medium and how this leads to a larger phase accumulation over the same physical distance.

\vspace{1em}
\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:phase_accumulation}
\end{figure}

If two waves propagate through the same length $L$ but experience different refractive indices, they accumulate different phases.  
For two polarization components with refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$, the resulting phase difference is
\begin{equation}
\Delta\phi = (n_1 - n_2) k_0 L.
\end{equation}
In the Faraday effect, a magnetic field causes left- and right-circularly polarized light to experience slightly different refractive indices, $n_l \neq n_r$, so that a relative phase shift builds up between the two components.
This relative phase shift has a direct geometric consequence for the polarization state.  
Since a linearly polarized wave can be written as the superposition of left- and right-circularly polarized components of equal amplitude, a relative phase shift between these components rotates the resulting linear polarization direction.

For a phase difference $\Delta\phi$, the rotation angle of the polarization plane is
\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{\Delta\phi}{2},
\end{equation}
which follows by explicitly adding the two circular fields and using trigonometric identities.

Inserting the expression for $\Delta\phi$ yields
\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{(n_l - n_r) k_0 L}{2} = \frac{(n_l - n_r) (2\pi / \lambda_0) L}{2} = \frac{\pi}{\lambda_0}(n_l - n_r)L,
\end{equation}
which relates the observed Faraday rotation directly to the refractive index difference of the two circular polarization modes.

\subsection{Microscopic Origin of \texorpdfstring{$n_l \neq n_r$}{} in an Axial Magnetic Field}

The refractive index of a transparent medium originates from the interaction between the electric field of the light wave and the bound electrons in the material.
When an electromagnetic wave propagates through a dielectric, its oscillating electric field drives small oscillatory motions of the electrons around their equilibrium positions.
These driven charges re-radiate electromagnetic waves, and the superposition of the incident and re-radiated fields leads to a phase delay of the transmitted wave.
On a macroscopic level, this phase delay is described by the refractive index $n$, which therefore reflects how strongly the electrons in the medium respond to the applied optical field.

In the absence of a magnetic field, the medium is isotropic with respect to the sense of rotation of the electric field.
Left- and right-circularly polarized light then drive equivalent electronic motions, and both polarization components experience the same refractive index.
As a result, $n_l = n_r$ and no Faraday rotation occurs.

Applying a magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ along the propagation direction introduces a preferred axial direction and breaks this symmetry.
In the classical picture, the electron motion induced by the optical electric field acquires an additional contribution from the magnetic Lorentz force
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_B = -e\,\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{v}$ is the electron velocity.
This force bends the electron trajectories in a way that depends on the sense of their rotational motion relative to the magnetic field direction.
As a consequence, electrons driven by left- and right-circularly polarized light respond slightly differently, leading to different polarization strengths and phase delays for the two circular components.
On the macroscopic level, this manifests itself as a small difference between the refractive indices $n_l$ and $n_r$, a phenomenon known as circular birefringence.

The same effect can also be understood from a minimal quantum-mechanical viewpoint.
A helpful way to think about this is that the refractive index of a dielectric is ultimately determined by how easily its bound electrons can be excited by an optical electric field.
In typical optical glasses, the strongest electronic excitations correspond to transitions at much higher frequencies, usually in the ultraviolet.
Visible light is therefore far away from these resonances and is transmitted with little absorption.
Nevertheless, even far from resonance the electrons are still driven weakly by the optical field, and this weak response determines the refractive index observed in the visible range.

Because the electronic response depends on how close the driving frequency is to an underlying resonance, the refractive index is generally not constant but depends on wavelength, $n = n(\lambda)$.
This wavelength dependence is known as dispersion and reflects the gradual change of the electronic phase response with optical frequency.
When a magnetic field is applied, the electronic energy levels associated with these resonances are shifted slightly due to the Zeeman effect.
Since left- and right-circularly polarized light carry opposite angular momentum, they couple to different Zeeman-shifted transitions, which are commonly referred to as $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ transitions.
As a result, the two circular polarization components effectively probe slightly different parts of the dispersive response curve $n(\lambda)$.
This leads to a small difference between the refractive indices experienced by left- and right-circularly polarized light, again resulting in $n_l \neq n_r$.

Both the classical and the quantum pictures therefore lead to the same conclusion.
An axial magnetic field introduces a handedness into the medium and breaks the equivalence between left- and right-circularly polarized light.
This difference in the optical response is encoded in a small refractive index difference $\Delta n = n_l - n_r$, which ultimately gives rise to the observed rotation of the plane of linear polarization.
 
\subsection{Dispersion, the Verdet Constant, and the Becquerel Relation}

Since the refractive index of a dielectric depends on wavelength, $n = n(\lambda)$, a small magnetic-field-induced shift of the underlying electronic response can be described by stating that the two circular polarization components effectively sample the dispersion curve at slightly different wavelengths.
We therefore write
\begin{equation}
n_l \approx n(\lambda + \Delta\lambda), \qquad n_r \approx n(\lambda - \Delta\lambda),
\end{equation}
where $\Delta\lambda$ is small and proportional to the applied magnetic field $B$.
This parameter does not represent a change of the light wavelength itself, but rather encodes the small Zeeman-induced shift of the electronic resonance that determines the dispersive optical response.

For sufficiently small $\Delta\lambda$, the refractive index can be expanded to first order,
\begin{equation}
n(\lambda \pm \Delta\lambda) \approx n(\lambda) \pm \Delta\lambda \frac{dn}{d\lambda}.
\end{equation}
Taking the difference of the two expressions yields
\begin{equation}
\Delta n = n_l - n_r \approx 2 \Delta\lambda \frac{dn}{d\lambda}.
\end{equation}

We now insert this result into the expression for the Faraday rotation angle derived earlier,
\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{\pi}{\lambda_0} \Delta n\, L.
\end{equation}
This gives
\begin{equation}
\theta \approx \frac{\pi}{\lambda_0} \left(2 \Delta\lambda \frac{dn}{d\lambda}\right) L.
\end{equation}
Since $\Delta\lambda$ is proportional to the magnetic field $B$, the rotation angle is linear in both $B$ and the optical path length $L$.
This motivates writing the Faraday rotation in the form
\begin{equation}
\theta = V(\lambda)\, B\, L,
\end{equation}
which defines the wavelength-dependent Verdet constant $V(\lambda)$.

A more detailed microscopic treatment of the electron dynamics, in which bound electrons are modeled as driven oscillators in the presence of a magnetic field, leads to an explicit expression for $V(\lambda)$.
In this approach, the Zeeman splitting of circular electron motion results in the so-called Becquerel relation,
\begin{equation}
V(\lambda) = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{e}{m_e^* c}\,\lambda\,\frac{dn}{d\lambda},
\label{eq:becquerel}
\end{equation}
where $e$ is the elementary charge, $c$ the speed of light, and $m_e^*$ an effective electron mass characterizing the optical response of the material.
This relation shows explicitly that the strength of Faraday rotation is governed by the dispersion of the refractive index and is therefore strongly wavelength dependent.

\subsection{Modulation Method and Signal Extraction}

The goal of this part of the experiment is to measure very small Faraday rotation angles $\theta$ with high sensitivity.
Instead of directly determining the rotation angle by mechanically adjusting optical components, the rotation is converted into a measurable change of light intensity behind a polarizing element.
This allows the rotation to be extracted from electrical detector signals with high precision.

After passing through the sample, the light is linearly polarized but rotated by the Faraday angle $\theta$.
The analyzer is a second polarizer placed behind the sample, whose purpose is to convert changes in polarization direction into changes in transmitted intensity.
The transmitted intensity behind the analyzer is described by Malus' law,
\begin{equation}
I = I_0 \cos^2 \phi,
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ is the angle between the polarization direction of the light and the transmission axis of the analyzer.

If the polarization is rotated by a small Faraday angle $\theta$, the effective angle becomes $\phi + \theta$, and the transmitted intensity is
\begin{equation}
I(\theta) = I_0 \cos^2(\phi + \theta).
\end{equation}
The analyzer angle $\phi$ is chosen deliberately to maximize the sensitivity of the transmitted intensity to small changes in $\theta$.

The analyzer is set to $\phi = 45^\circ$, because at this angle the slope of the $\cos^2$ function is maximal and approximately linear in the vicinity of the working point.
This means that small polarization rotations lead to the largest possible relative change in intensity.
This behavior is illustrated schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:malus_slope}.

\vspace{1em}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{../resources/figures/malus_slope.png}
\caption{Schematic illustration of Malus' law $I \propto \cos^2 \phi$.
At $\phi = 45^\circ$ the slope of the curve is maximal and approximately linear, which makes this angle an optimal working point for detecting small polarization rotations.}
\label{fig:malus_slope}
\end{figure}

For small Faraday rotation angles $\theta \ll 1$, the intensity can be expanded around the working point $\phi = 45^\circ$.
Using a first-order Taylor expansion of $\cos^2(\phi + \theta)$, one obtains
\begin{equation}
I(\theta) \approx \frac{I_0}{2} - I_0 \theta.
\end{equation}
This expression shows that the transmitted intensity consists of a constant offset and a term that depends linearly on the rotation angle.
The linear dependence is essential, because it allows the rotation angle to be determined directly from changes in intensity.

During the measurement, the magnetic field is not applied statically but is modulated sinusoidally by driving the solenoid with an alternating current.
As a result, the Faraday rotation angle oscillates in time,
\begin{equation}
\theta(t) = \theta_B \sin(\Omega t),
\end{equation}
where $\theta_B$ is the rotation amplitude and $\Omega$ the modulation frequency.
The intensity behind the analyzer therefore becomes
\begin{equation}
I(t) \approx I_{DC} + I_{AC} \sin(\Omega t),
\end{equation}
with a constant component
\begin{equation}
I_{DC} = \frac{I_0}{2}
\end{equation}
and an oscillating component of amplitude
\begin{equation}
I_{AC} = I_0 \theta_B.
\end{equation}

Experimentally, the light intensity behind the analyzer is detected by a photodiode, which converts the optical signal into an electrical voltage.
This voltage contains both a constant (time-averaged) part and a small oscillating part.
The constant component $I_{DC}$ is measured using a multimeter in DC mode, while the oscillating component is observed with an oscilloscope.

On the oscilloscope, the oscillation is typically read as a peak-to-peak signal.
This quantity is denoted by $I_{SS}$, where ``SS'' refers to the peak-to-peak swing of the signal.
Since the peak-to-peak value is twice the oscillation amplitude, one has
\begin{equation}
I_{SS} = 2 I_{AC}.
\end{equation}
Using $I_0 = 2 I_{DC}$, the rotation amplitude can therefore be written as
\begin{equation}
\theta_B = \frac{I_{SS}}{4 I_{DC}}.
\end{equation}

In real optical systems, the transmitted intensity does not vanish completely even when the polarizers are crossed.
This can be caused by imperfect polarizers, slight misalignments, or stress-induced changes of the polarization state inside the glass.
To account for this, a modified form of Malus' law is used,
\begin{equation}
I(\phi) = (I_{\parallel} - I_{\perp}) \cos^2 \phi + I_{\perp},
\end{equation}
where $I_{\parallel}$ and $I_{\perp}$ are the intensities measured for parallel and crossed polarizers, respectively.

From these quantities, a contrast factor
\begin{equation}
K = \frac{I_{\parallel} - I_{\perp}}{I_{\parallel} + I_{\perp}}
\end{equation}
is defined, which quantifies how well the polarization modulation is preserved.
Including this correction, the experimentally relevant expression for the Faraday rotation amplitude becomes
\begin{equation}
\theta_B = \frac{1}{K} \frac{I_{SS}}{4 I_{DC}}.
\end{equation}

This modulation-based detection method allows very small Faraday rotations to be extracted reliably from electrical signals, even in the presence of slow drifts and imperfections in the setup.

\subsection{Magnetic Field Calibration and Length-Averaged Field}

In the experiment, the magnetic field required for Faraday rotation is generated by a solenoid surrounding the optical sample.
While the Faraday rotation angle is proportional to the magnetic field, the field produced by a finite solenoid is not perfectly homogeneous along the optical propagation direction.
As a result, different parts of the sample experience slightly different magnetic field strengths.

Since the Faraday rotation accumulates continuously along the optical path, the total rotation angle is given by the integral of the local contribution,
\begin{equation}
\theta = \int_0^L V(\lambda)\, B(z)\, \mathrm{d}z,
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the length of the sample and $B(z)$ is the magnetic flux density along the propagation direction.
Because the Verdet constant is uniform within the sample and the rotation depends linearly on $B$, this expression can be rewritten in terms of a length-averaged magnetic field,
\begin{equation}
\theta = V(\lambda)\, \bar{B}\, L,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\bar{B} = \frac{1}{L} \int_0^L B(z)\, \mathrm{d}z.
\end{equation}

This definition shows that the Faraday rotation depends only on the average magnetic field experienced by the light inside the material, not on the exact spatial distribution of the field.
Using the averaged field therefore allows the standard Faraday relation $\theta = VBL$ to remain valid even for a non-uniform solenoid field.

In practice, the magnetic field profile $B(z)$ is determined experimentally by measuring the axial field of the solenoid as a function of position using a Hall probe.
From this measured field profile, the length-averaged magnetic field is calculated and used in the determination of the Verdet constant.
For $N$ discrete field values $B(z_i)$ measured at positions $z_i$ with approximately constant spacing $\Delta z$, the integral average is approximated by
\begin{equation}
B_{\mathrm{avg}} \approx \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{N} B(z_i)\,\Delta z \,=\, \frac{\Delta z}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{N} B(z_i).
\label{eq:Bavg_discrete}
\end{equation}

During the actual Faraday-rotation measurements, the solenoid is not driven with a static current but with an alternating current, such that the magnetic field oscillates sinusoidally in time.
The calibration measurements performed with a direct current therefore correspond to the effective (root-mean-square) value of the magnetic field.

For a sinusoidally modulated magnetic field, the amplitude of the length-averaged flux density is related to its effective value by
\begin{equation}
B_{\mathrm{Ampl}} = \sqrt{2}\,\bar{B}.
\label{eq:B_amplitude}
\end{equation}

This relation allows the DC calibration of the solenoid field to be converted into the corresponding magnetic field amplitude relevant for the modulated Faraday-rotation measurements.

\subsection{Dispersion Model for \texorpdfstring{$n(\lambda)$}{} and Determination of \texorpdfstring{$\lambda_R$ and $N$}{}}

In order to relate the measured Faraday rotation to microscopic material parameters, a quantitative description of the wavelength dependence of the refractive index is required.
In transparent optical glasses, light in the visible range does not excite real electronic transitions.
Instead, the optical field drives bound electrons at frequencies far below their natural resonance frequencies, which are typically located in the ultraviolet.
The observed dispersion of the refractive index therefore reflects the off-resonant response of these electrons rather than absorption processes.

In this situation, the detailed electronic level structure is not resolved, and the dispersive behavior can be approximated by a single effective resonance.
This leads to a simple one-resonance dispersion model, in which the refractive index is written as
\begin{equation}
n^2(\lambda) = 1 + \frac{N e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m_e^*} \frac{1}{\omega_R^2 - \omega^2},
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the density of optically active electrons, $m_e^*$ is an effective electron mass, $\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda$ is the optical angular frequency, and $\omega_R$ denotes the angular resonance frequency of the effective oscillator.
This expression corresponds to the response of bound electrons modeled as driven harmonic oscillators far below resonance.

To obtain a form suitable for data evaluation, the frequency dependence is rewritten in terms of the wavelength.
Using $\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda$ and $\omega_R = 2\pi c / \lambda_R$, the denominator can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\omega_R^2 - \omega^2 = (2\pi c)^2 \left( \frac{1}{\lambda_R^2} - \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \right).
\end{equation}
Inserting this into the dispersion relation and rearranging yields
\begin{equation}
n^2(\lambda) - 1 = \frac{N e^2}{\varepsilon_0 m_e^* (2\pi c)^2} \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\lambda_R^2} - \frac{1}{\lambda^2}}.
\end{equation}
Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n^2(\lambda) - 1} = \frac{\varepsilon_0 m_e^* (2\pi c)^2}{N e^2}
\left( \frac{1}{\lambda^2} - \frac{1}{\lambda_R^2} \right).
\end{equation}

This expression is linear in $1/\lambda^2$ and can therefore be written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n^2(\lambda) - 1} = A \frac{1}{\lambda^2} - B,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{\varepsilon_0 m_e^* (2\pi c)^2}{N e^2},
\qquad
B = \frac{\varepsilon_0 m_e^* (2\pi c)^2}{N e^2} \frac{1}{\lambda_R^2}.
\end{equation}
According to this model, a plot of $1/(n^2 - 1)$ versus $1/\lambda^2$ yields a straight line with slope $A$ and intercept $-B$.

The refractive index values $n(\lambda)$ entering this model are taken from literature data for the respective glass types used in the experiment.
For each wavelength $\lambda$ of the employed LEDs, the corresponding refractive index $n(\lambda)$ is obtained from an external database as specified in the preparation task~\cite{FARAnleitung}.
These tabulated pairs $(\lambda, n)$ then form the input for the dispersion analysis carried out in the evaluation.

From the ratio of slope and intercept, the effective resonance wavelength of the model oscillator is obtained as
\begin{equation}
\lambda_R = \sqrt{\frac{A}{B}}.
\end{equation}
The parameter $\lambda_R$ does not correspond to a specific optical transition but characterizes the dominant electronic resonance that governs the dispersion behavior in the visible range.

The relevance of $\lambda_R$ becomes clear when the dispersion analysis is combined with the Faraday rotation measurements.
From the wavelength dependence of the Verdet constant, the effective electron mass $m_e^*$ is determined independently by fitting the Becquerel relation to the experimental Faraday rotation data.
With $m_e^*$ thus known, the slope $A$ of the linear dispersion plot can be used to calculate the density of optically active electrons as
\begin{equation}
N = \frac{\varepsilon_0 m_e^* (2\pi c)^2}{A e^2}.
\label{eq:N_from_slope}
\end{equation}
In this way, the refractive index dispersion and the magneto-optical response are linked consistently, allowing microscopic material parameters to be extracted from macroscopic optical measurements.

The experimental setup as is shown in picture \ref{fig:schematic_setup} consists of a LED that emittes light that is shown through a collector lense that creates a parallel beam,

The light the comes from the LED is shown through a lense collector lense that creates a parallel beam. The beam then passes through a linear polarizer and then through an iris diaphragm to confine the beam so that unwanted reflections are minimized. Then the light passes through a glassblock that is surrounded by a coil, which creates the magnetic field. 
Then comes another polarizer, which is used as an analyzer, the transmitted light is then focused by another lense and detected by a silica photodiode with an integrated organic photovoltaic.

The coil for the magnetic field is powered by a frequency generator with an integrated amplifier. The current that passes through the coil is measured with an amperemeter. The signal from the detector is simultaniously measured with an amperemeter and an oscilloscope, where the amperemeter measures the DC component and the oscilloscope the AC component.

For the examination of the wavelength dependence there are differently colored LEDs.

\section{Procedure}

\subsection{Task 1 (Preparation)}

For the two optical glasses N-BK7 and SF10, tabulated refractive-index data $n(\lambda)$ are obtained from the database \texttt{refractiveindex.info} as specified in the lab manual~\cite{FARAnleitung}.

For each wavelength $\lambda_i$, the data are transformed into $x_i = 1/\lambda_i^2$ and $y_i = 1/(n(\lambda_i)^2 - 1)$.

For each glass type, the transformed data $y$ are plotted versus $x$, and a linear fit of the form $y = A x - B$ is performed to obtain the slope $A$ and the intercept $-B$.

From the fitted parameters, the effective resonance wavelength of the single-oscillator model is calculated as $\lambda_R = \sqrt{A/B}$.

The extracted slope $A$ is retained for later evaluation tasks, where it enters the determination of further microscopic material parameters.

\subsection{Task 2}

With the axial Hall probe of the teslameter, the axial magnetic flux density $B(z)$ is measured along the solenoid axis inside the coil at a fixed direct current (e.g. $I = 0.8\,\mathrm{A}$).

The field is recorded at discrete positions $z_i$ with approximately constant spacing $\Delta z$ over the region relevant for the sample.

From the measured values $B(z_i)$, the length-averaged magnetic flux density $B_{\mathrm{avg}}$ is calculated using Eq.~\ref{eq:Bavg_discrete}.

\subsection{Task 3}

The calibration curve of the magnetic flux density is determined by measuring the length-averaged magnetic field $\bar{B}$ as a function of the coil current $I$ in the range $0 < I < 2\,\mathrm{A}$.

For several selected current values, the corresponding averaged magnetic flux density $\bar{B}(I)$ is obtained using the procedure described in Task~2.

The resulting values are used to establish the calibration curve $B = f(I)$.
For later measurements with an alternating current, the amplitude of the averaged magnetic flux density is obtained from the DC calibration using Eq.~\ref{eq:B_amplitude}.

\subsection{Task 4}

The experimental setup for the measurement of the Faraday rotation is assembled according to Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic_setup}.

The LED and the first lens are adjusted such that a beam that is as parallel as possible is produced.
Using the iris diaphragm, the beam diameter is reduced to ensure that the light propagates through the glass block without intersecting the longitudinal side faces, in order to avoid internal reflections within the glass.

The glass block is positioned inside the solenoid along the optical axis.
When handling the glass block, the cotton gloves provided at the experimental station are used.

\subsection{Task 5}

With the glass block removed and the magnetic field switched off, Malus’ law is verified for a fixed wavelength.

The first polarizer is kept at a fixed orientation, while the analyzer is rotated over an angular range from $0^\circ$ to $180^\circ$.
For each analyzer angle $\phi$, the transmitted intensity $I(\phi)$ is measured and the resulting curve is recorded.

From the measured intensity curve, the maximum intensity $I_{\parallel}$ and the minimum intensity $I_{\perp}$ are determined.
Using these values, the contrast
\begin{equation}
K = \frac{I_{\parallel} - I_{\perp}}{I_{\parallel} + I_{\perp}}
\end{equation}
and the degree of polarization
\begin{equation}
G = \frac{I_{\parallel}}{I_{\perp}}
\end{equation}
are calculated.

\subsection{Task 6}

The measurement of Malus’ law is repeated with the glass block inserted into the beam path and with the magnetic field switched off.

The first polarizer is kept at a fixed orientation, while the analyzer is rotated over an angular range from $0^\circ$ to $180^\circ$.
For each analyzer angle $\varphi$, the transmitted intensity $I(\varphi)$ is measured and recorded.

From the resulting intensity curve, the maximum intensity $I_{\parallel}$ and the minimum intensity $I_{\perp}$ are determined.
Using these values, the contrast
\begin{equation}
K = \frac{I_{\parallel} - I_{\perp}}{I_{\parallel} + I_{\perp}}
\end{equation}
and the degree of polarization
\begin{equation}
G = \frac{I_{\parallel}}{I_{\perp}}
\end{equation}
are calculated.

In addition, the slope of the intensity curve $\mathrm{d}I/\mathrm{d}\varphi$ is determined at the analyzer angle $\varphi = 45^\circ$.

\subsection{Task 7}

With the glass block inserted and the magnetic field switched off, the optical alignment of the setup is optimized to achieve a degree of polarization of $G > 40$.

For each alignment step, the analyzer is first set parallel to the fixed polarizer to measure the maximum transmitted intensity $I_{\parallel}$.
The analyzer is then rotated by $90^\circ$ to the crossed position to measure the minimum transmitted intensity $I_{\perp}$.

From these two readings, the degree of polarization $G = I_{\parallel}/I_{\perp}$ is calculated.
The alignment is iteratively adjusted and the procedure is repeated until $G > 40$ is reached.

\subsection{Task 8}

The magnetic field is modulated by driving the solenoid with an alternating current at a frequency in the range $40\,\mathrm{Hz} \le \Omega \le 90\,\mathrm{Hz}$.

For a fixed wavelength, the first polarizer is kept at a constant orientation while the analyzer angle $\varphi$ is varied.
For each analyzer angle, the peak-to-peak amplitude $I_{SS}$ of the intensity modulation is measured using the oscilloscope.

The measured values $I_{SS}(\varphi)$ are plotted as a function of the analyzer angle.
From this dependence, it is verified that the modulation signal reaches its maximum at $\varphi = 45^\circ$.

\subsection{Task 9}

For each of the five LED wavelengths, the Faraday rotation is measured for four different magnetic field strengths.

The analyzer is set to the working point $\varphi = 45^\circ$ and the magnetic field strength is varied by adjusting the frequency generator settings.

For each field setting, the effective coil current $I_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as well as the corresponding detector signals $I_{DC}$ and $I_{SS}$ are recorded.

The recorded values are used to determine the Faraday rotation amplitude $\theta_B$ for each wavelength and magnetic field strength using the signal-extraction relation from the Physical Principles section, including the contrast correction factor $K$.

\subsection{Task 10}

For each wavelength, the measured rotation angles $\theta$ are plotted as a function of the magnetic field amplitude $\bar{B}_{\mathrm{Ampl}}$ in a common graphical representation.

For each wavelength, the Verdet constant $V(\lambda)$ is determined from the slope of the corresponding $\theta(\bar{B}_{\mathrm{Ampl}})$ dependence.

Using the Becquerel relation, Eq.~\ref{eq:becquerel}, the effective oscillator mass $m_e^*$ of the dispersion electrons is calculated.
For this purpose, the values of $\mathrm{d}n/\mathrm{d}\lambda$ for the glass type BK7 are taken from \texttt{refractiveindex.info}.

\subsection{Task 11}

From the slope $A$ of the linear dispersion plot $1/(n^2-1)$ versus $1/\lambda^2$ obtained in Task~1 and using the effective electron mass $m_e^*$ determined in Task~10, the density $N$ of dispersion electrons is calculated according to Eq.~\ref{eq:N_from_slope}.

The resulting electron density $N$ is then compared to the number density of atoms (or formula units) of the respective glass, which is calculated from the given material density and chemical composition.

\subsection{Task 12}

The investigations described in Tasks~9 to~11 are repeated analogously for the glass type SF10.

The corresponding Verdet constants, effective electron mass, and dispersion-electron density are determined using the same evaluation procedures as for BK7.
